  ``CoCo'' is a statistics package for analysis of associations between
  discrete variables.  ``CoCo'' is a highly advanced interactive program
  for estimation, test and model search among hierarchical interaction
  models for large complete contingency tables.

  ``association-dialog-proto'' is a graphical tool for handling causal
  mixed association models by ``CoCo'' in XLISP-STAT.
